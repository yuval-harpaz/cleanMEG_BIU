Instruction for off-line cleaning MEG data
19-Jul-2011

Move to the cleanMEG directory:
>> cd cleanMEG
>> addpath(pwd);
>> fileName = 'D:\DATA\MEG\Noise\2010_10_26\Digital\2\c,rfhp1.0Hz';
>> p=pdf4D(fileName);
>> cleanCoefs = createCleanFileH(p, fileName,'byLF',[256,512] ,...
      'Method','Adaptive' , 'xClean',[4,5,6], 'chans2ignore',[74,204] ,...
      'byFFT',1 , 'HeartBeat',0.8, 'RInclude','Automatic', ...
      'stepCorrect',1);
Use 
>> help createCleanFileF 
to understand what the various options are.

This will produce a file named:  'xc,cf,hb,lf_c,rfhp1.0Hz'
In the same directory as the original file

Save the resulting  cleanCoefs for finding where there 
were problems. Also, in the future
they will be needed for source localization.


If you donot want to clean by Heart-Beats use
    'HeartBeat',0
If you do not want to clean by FFT use
    'byFFT',0
If there is no accelerometers signal to clean, eliminate
    'xClean',[4,5,6]
If there are no channels to ignore, eliminate
    'chans2ignore',[74,204]
However the program may still decide that some channels are bad and 
ignore them.  A warning message is issued in this case. You may 
overcome some of these automatic detection by adding:
'hugeVal', 1e-6 (the default is 1e-8).
Ignored channels are left as they are without any cleaning.
